										<h3>About</h3>
									</header>
									<p>My name is Shivang Saxena, and I'm a Computer Science & Engineering Major at The Ohio State Univesity in Columbus, Ohio. While I'm passionate about almost all areas of technology, most of my projects are centered around web and app development. I've released games and apps on Android, and also developed a few web apps (which can be found in the projects below). My passion for technology is continuing to grow as I learn and use more languages and tools, and I'm looking to further expand on this by participating in a co-op or internship in the US during the summer of 2018. Please get in touch!</p>

												<h4><a href="http://regarde.tk">Regarde.tk</a></h4>
												<p>When in a call with my friends, I found it frustrating that there was no easy way to share my screen. Sure, I could ask my friend to download and install software, enter my connection ID, etc, but I knew there had to be a better way. I created Regarde to solve that issue. Regarde allows users to share their screen with others without the need to install any software. The best part, it's completely secure and peer to peer. By using WebRTC I am able to cut bandwith costs by 85%! <a href="https://regarde.tk">Try it out!</a></p>

												<h4><a href="https://github.com/Shivang44/screenur">Screenur</a></h4>
												<p>There are thousands of screenshot tools out there. What makes Screenur any different? Simply put, it's extremely quick. Pressing CTRL+SHIFT+3 immediately takes a screenshot, compresses the image, uploads it to imgur.com, copies the url to your clipboard, and opens the url in your browser. Everything is automatic. Pressing CTRL+SHIFT+4 does the same thing but allows you to select a region. It's a very specialized screenshot tool written in C++ using the Win32 API, GDI+, and libcurl libraries. Best of all, there's no install required. <a href="https://github.com/Shivang44/screenur">Try it out</a> and see what you've been missing :)</p>

												<h4><a href="#">Shortpoll</a></h4>
												<p><a href="#">Shortpoll</a> is a realtime polling app I worked on over the summer of 2016. It allows users to create a poll, which generates a poll url that can be visited by any device. As other users as the poll, results are updated in realtime (using websockets and redis) and these results can be seen as a bar graph and pie chart in realtime (more graphs planned in the future!). It is written in Nodejs, and code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Shivang44/shortpoll">Github.</a></p>

												<h4>Pillar Pass</h4>
												<p>Pillar Pass was my first attempt at developing an android game. It quickly became my most popular project at 5,000+ downloads on the play store. It's fast paced, endless (proceduarally generated), and incredibly addicting (as I'm told). It features an online highscore system that I developed in PHP & MySQL, along with a proceduerally generated gameworld in C# and the Unity3D game engine. Download it on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Zhinkk.PillarPass">Play store</a> and try it out!</p>

												<h4>Advanced Energy Vehicle</h4>
												<p>In this semester-long project, my team designed and built an arduino powered energy efficient vechile to complete the mission concept review presented in the course. Each step of the research, prototype, and analysis phases were documented in executive summaries, lab reports, and design reviews.</p>
